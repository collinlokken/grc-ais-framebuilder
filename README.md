# grc-ais-framebuilder
Python block AIS Framebuilder written for GNU Radio Companion.

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the works carried out by (Trendmicro)[https://github.com/trendmicro/ais], who made the original AIS Frame Builder block in C++. Building on this, we have written an equivalent block in Python, which is now supported as an embedded block in GRC >=3.8. This block enables customization, and allows AIS ship values to be assigned at runtime using GRC widgets.
